A client for the TTTP protocol. Supports all aspects of the current version of the protocol, including authentication, encryption, and pasting. Fairly command-line oriented and not very thoroughly tested... pasting support and "file-based passwords" are not tested at all. Should work on Windows (good luck building it) and most Unices. Build not tested on Mac OS X but the Cocoa code in TEG _is_ tested, so...
